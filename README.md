## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Bookstore Website** — it showcases books, allows users to add them to the cart, update quantities, and see the total cost.  
The cart and theme (Light/Dark) are saved in the browser using `localStorage` so they remain consistent across pages.  
**Firebase** is used to store and manage data, including user orders and authentication.
